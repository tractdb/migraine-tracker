            {"question": "What lifestyle changes can help me guard against migraine?",
            "answer": "We recommend exercising regularly, minimizing sugar and other carbohydrates, consistently getting appropriate amounts of sleep (around 8 hours for most people), and practicing stress reduction techniques. Research suggests these changes help guard against migraine, perhaps by increasing serotonin levels."},

            {"question": "Why should I minimize as-needed medications?",
            "answer": "When people with migraine take too many as-needed medications, they can be more susceptible to migraines in the future, causing a bad cycle of getting more migraines and taking more medications.  This cycle is one of the most common reasons people develop chronic migraine, and the number one change that can help people reduce their symptoms."}

        [
            {"question": "Why do you call them 'contributors'?",
            "answer": "Despite the common terminology, for most people, single factors do not 'trigger' migraines.  Instead, people who are susceptible to migraine may be more likely to get one when exposed to multiple factors they may be sensitive to. As those factors often need to accumulate for a migraine to occur, we say they 'contribute' to migraines."},

            {"question": "Why is identifying contributors so difficult?",
            "answer": "Different people are affected by different contributors, so recommendations based on other people with migraine don't always apply.  In addition, as contributors often must accumulate to cause a migraine, figuring out exactly what contributed to a particular migraine is often difficult.  We therefore strongly recommend lifestyle changes that can help guard against symptoms, instead of trying to identify every possible contributing factor (see Treatments section)."},

            {"question": "If I think something is a contributing factor, do I need to cut it out of my life?",
            "answer": "Instead of always trying to avoid contributors, we recommend lifestyle changes that can help guard against symptoms even when exposed to contributing factors (see Treatments section).  However, if you have an important event coming up or you feel like you may have been exposed to more contributors than usual, you may want to minimize further exposure."},

            {"question": "Why is frequent use of as-needed medications listed as a contributor?",
            "answer": "When people with migraine take too many as-needed medications, they can be more susceptible to migraines in the future, causing a bad cycle of getting more migraines and taking more medications.  This cycle is one of the most common reasons people develop chronic migraine, and the number one change that can help people reduce their symptoms."}
